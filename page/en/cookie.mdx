## [What is cookies?](#what-is-cookies)

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username
and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use
a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are
used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing
experience.
<br />
Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your
connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your
computer.
<br />
When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network
server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to
specifically serve to you.
