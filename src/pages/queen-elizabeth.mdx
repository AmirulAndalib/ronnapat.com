    I was so sorry for the people of the United Kingdom for losing a talented and greatest queen!

    Personally, I want to say that I suddenly shock when I heard the news about the Death of Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

    Queen has a strong bond with the people of the UK and the world.

    Rest In Peace
