    # About me

    My name is Ronnapat Srivoravilai you can also call me <span className="underline decoration-sky-500 text-black dark:text-white font-semibold decoration-2">Pie</span>.

    I was born in <span className="text-black dark:text-white">Bangkok, Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­</span> and now I'm {age} years old!

    I'm currently a student in a common school in Bangkok, Thailand. My time in this school is incredibly great! I learn a lot of things that can apply to my life.

    At school, I had done a lot of simple and challenging activities such as School Student Council, MC for school events, and Inventor. I'm looking forward to doing more activities with the resources that I already have.

    Most of my free time was in front of my computer play games but one day I suddenly think that I would be a person who create a games and make money not a person who pay to play games. After that I started learning algorithms and coding now most of my free time is still in front of my computer but I didn't play games anymore I just code.

    Another Topics that I like to learn is Mathematics. I'm not a genius in Mathematics but I like to learn it. It's fun to learn and it's fun to solve problems. I found it very useful when I need to solve or write a computer program in daily life.
