        I like developing software and Math. It's a very long time since I
        started learning how to code and develop software, I start to learn code
        by myself on my computer online. Math is my main goal in middle school
        period! At the first time when I learn math, I don't like it at all but
        when I can solve math quiz I start to have fun with it since then I
        really like math especially when I able to solve the math problem.
