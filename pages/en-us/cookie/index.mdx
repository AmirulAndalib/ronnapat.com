## [What is cookies?](#what-is-cookies)

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username
and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use
a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are
used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing
experience.

Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your
connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your
computer.

When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network
server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to
specifically serve to you.
